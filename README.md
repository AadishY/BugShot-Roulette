## 🎬 About

**Aadish Roulette** is a web-based reimagining of the deadly shotgun game, inspired by Mike Klubnika's *Buckshot Roulette*. Built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js, it features 3D layouts, retro CRT filters, atmospheric volumetric lighting, and strategic item play.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Enter Your Identity**: Input your codename and click "Bind Soul" on the startup terminal.
2. **Mag Capacity**: A magazine of 2 to 8 random shells is loaded. You are shown how many are **LIVE** (red) and how many are **BLANK** (blue).
3. **Choosing Targets**: Shoot the dealer (1 damage if Live, turn ends) or yourself (if Blank, you retain your turn!).
4. **Use Items**: Strategically consume items before grabbing the gun to turn the odds in your favor.
5. **Win or Die**: Knock the opponent's health to 0 to advance or win.

## 📜 Changelog

### v2.1.2 (Slot Machine Model & Staggered Spins)
- **Upgraded Jackpot Slot Machine 3D Model**: Developed a larger, premium 3D cabinet housing featuring three separate horizontal cylinders, golden chrome panels, vertical divider trims, and high-definition vertical emoji canvas strips.
- **Realistic Staggered Spin Physics**: Programmed sequential wheel braking (Left reel at 1.8s, Center at 2.15s, Right at 2.5s) decelerating smoothly via a trigonometric ease-out curve.
- **Jackpot Probability Redesign**: Tuned spin outcome distributions to: 20% Jackpot Win (7-7-7 reel match), 30% Normal Win (Cherry-Cherry-Lemon match), and 50% No Win (Apple-Lemon-Bell match).

### v2.1.1 (Performance Safeguards & Jackpot Refinements)
- **Performance Detector**: Integrated real-time frame rate monitoring in the ThreeJS canvas loop. Automatically prompts players with a CRT warning pop-up if the frame rate dips below 30 FPS, giving quick controls to switch graphics profiles to Balanced or Potato.
- **Exempt Blank Shots**: Prevent blank shells (fired by either the Player or Dealer) from decrementing the player's Jackpot immunity. Only live shots and Blood Contract sacrifices decrement immunity.
- **Blood Contract Integration**: Using a Blood Contract with active Jackpot immunity consumes 1 immunity shot and triggers the RCT healing animation sequence instead of permanently losing 1 HP.
- **Persistent Jackpot Loop**: Ensured that the Jackpot win background loop persists across round transitions and shotgun reloads if the player still has remaining immunity.

### v2.1.0 (Jackpot Protocols & Audio Dimming)
- **Jackpot Audio Fixed**: Realigned slot machine audio pathways (`slotmachine`, `jackpot`, and `jackpotloop` files loaded properly).
- **Dynamic Music Dimming**: Game music dims to 35% during standard item SFX, and to 5% (almost muted) while the Jackpot looping immunity theme is active.
- **Inventory Icon Fix**: Jackpot item now successfully renders a golden Coins icon in inventory, loot, and debug screens.
- **Drop Rate Balancing**:
  - Normal Mode: Jackpot is a rare drop (2.0%) just above Totem (1.0%).
  - Hard Mode: Totem (1.0%) and Jackpot (1.0%) are equal rarity.
- **Debug Relocation**: Reorganized Developer console panel, renaming the 'Tarot' section to 'Item Power' and moving the Jackpot forced win cheats there.
