## 🎬 About

**Aadish Roulette** is a web-based reimagining of the deadly shotgun game, inspired by Mike Klubnika's *Buckshot Roulette*. Built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js, it features 3D layouts, retro CRT filters, atmospheric volumetric lighting, and strategic item play.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Enter Your Identity**: Input your codename and click "Bind Soul" on the startup terminal.
2. **Mag Capacity**: A magazine of 2 to 8 random shells is loaded. You are shown how many are **LIVE** (red) and how many are **BLANK** (blue).
3. **Choosing Targets**: Shoot the dealer (1 damage if Live, turn ends) or yourself (if Blank, you retain your turn!).
4. **Use Items**: Strategically consume items before grabbing the gun to turn the odds in your favor.
5. **Win or Die**: Knock the opponent's health to 0 to advance or win.
